# AniaMemoryGame

This is a codealong to Ania Kubow's Memory Game. There might be just a couple of slight differences (I used forEach where she used old school for loop). Maybe a couple of other minor 
differences. I really thought this was a great project when I coded along a few months ago. But I wanted to do it again, and really go piece by piece. I felt that some of 
the understanding eluded me the first time around because I went too fast. This time, I decided to use git and make many commits to ensure step by step learning and absoprtion. 
None of the material in and of itself is very difficult. But, for a beginner, there is just so much to absorb that it could be easily overwhelming. I think it's a great project that can really
help beginners lear about dom manipulation.
